# Chapter 1: Installation
---
Installing Odin should be fairly simple. 
If you cannot get Odin installed then visit the [Odin discord server](https://discord.gg/odinlang) and ask for help.
It is a very welcoming community! You can also visit the [odin-lang](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) website.
