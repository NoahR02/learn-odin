### Chapter 2.7: Slices
---
Slices are slices of memory. A slice contains a pointer to the data and an integer for the length, so it knows when to stop.
Slices are widely used in Odin code.

To declare a slice we do the following:
```cpp
slice: []int // slice of integers
```

Let's declare an array:
```cpp
my_array: [5]int = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

We can now take a slice of it. Let's take the first 3 elements.

The first number between the brackets is inclusive. 
You then put a colon and type one more number which will be exclusive.

Or in math terms [0, 3).

```cpp
slice = my_array[0 : 3]
```

If you print out slice then it will print [1, 2, 3] and have a length of 3.

When printing this you can think of the procedure going to the first element's memory
address and looping through it n amount of times where n is the length that the slice stores.
