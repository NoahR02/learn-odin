### Chapter 2.8: Enumerations
---

Enumerations hold a list of possible integer values which are constant.

Each time we define a new enum it becomes a whole new type.
This is useful because it gives context, 
for example if you want to pass a color to procedure then we could pass an instance of a color enum with a particular value.

Similar to defining a struct we can define Colors like so:
```shell
Note that you can leave out the type after enum and it will default to int.
```
```cpp
Colors :: enum int {
}
```

We can now put the possible values Colors can be.
```cpp
Colors :: enum int {
    RED, // 0
    GREEN = 100, // 100
    BLUE, // 101
}
```

An instance of Colors can only be 3 values: RED, GREEN, or BLUE. 
Colors.RED maps to 0 which is of type integer.
Colors.GREEN maps to 1 which is of type integer.
Colors.BLUE maps to 2 which is of type integer.

We can now define an instance of Colors.
```cpp
color: Colors = Colors.RED // Or .RED to be more implict.
```
