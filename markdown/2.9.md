### Chapter 2.9: Unions
---

Unions are a type that can hold multiple types. 
You can only access one type at a time with a union because the size of a union is the largest type that it can hold.

Here is how to define a union:
```cpp
Event_Data :: union {
```

We can then put the possible types we will use inside the union body.
```cpp
Event_Data :: union {
    [128] bool, // KEY_PRESSED array.
    [2]int,     // Window resize.
}
```

Let's declare an instance of Event_Data.
```cpp
event: Event_Data = [2]int{1600, 900}
```

event is now storing an array of two integers.

if we want to store an array of booleans with a size of 128 we can do the following:
```cpp
event = [128]bool {}
```
