### Chapter 1.1: Packages
Before we start writing code, we have to talk about packages in Odin. A Package is a folder with odin files.
We will expand on this later when we get to more advance programs.

Ok enough said! Let's make a package for our *Hello World* program.
1. Make a new folder with the name of your package. I'll be going with hello_world!
2. Make a file called hello_world.odin.
3. Inside that file write:
```cpp
package hello_world
```

That's it, we now have a package! In the next section we will finish writing our Hello World code in this file.
