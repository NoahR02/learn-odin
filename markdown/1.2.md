### Chapter 1.2: Writing our Hello World Program

So far your program should look something like this:
```cpp
package main
```

Next we will import a package called fmt from Odin's core collection. What is a collection?
A collection is a path to a folder containing packages. If you do not specify a collection, Odin will look for a package relative to your current file's directory.
The ***core*** collection is Odin's standard library for common things like reading files, string manipulation, json, and much more!

```cpp
package main

import "core:fmt"
```

The resulting code should look like this:
```cpp
package main
import "core:fmt"

main :: proc() {
    fmt.println("Hello World!")
}

```
